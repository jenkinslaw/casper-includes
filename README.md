casper-includes [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jenkinslaw/casper-includes.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jenkinslaw/casper-includes)
===============

This is a utility library to help generate casperjs functional test.
It's the core library for the [ecto](https://github.com/jenkinslaw/ecto) application.

Though, I pulled it out of there because I found it useful for other internal applications.

Running `ecto selftest` actually runs the tests included in this repo.
