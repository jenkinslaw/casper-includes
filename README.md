casper-includes
===============

This is a utility library to help generate casperjs functional test.
It's the core library for the [ecto](https://github.com/jenkinslaw/ecto) application.

Though, I pulled it out of there because I found it useful for other internal applications.

Running `ecto selftest` actually runs the tests included in this repo.
